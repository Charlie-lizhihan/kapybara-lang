# Kapybara Compiler üêæ

Hey there! Welcome to Kapybara, a quirky little compiler I whipped up for fun. It's a bit like C, but with its own twist and a lot more kapybara vibes!

## What's Kapybara?

Kapybara is all about having a good time while coding. It's not your typical serious programming language. Expect some fun syntax, cool features, and of course, some kapybara charm!

## Cool Features

- **Hash Data Structures**: Because who doesn't like a good hash table?
- **Array Data Structures**: Arrays are cool, so Kapybara has them too.
- **String Data Structures**: Playing around with strings is always fun.
- **Closures**: Kapybara can do closures; fancy, right?
- **Higher-order and First-class Functions**: Getting a bit more advanced here, but Kapybara handles it like a champ.
- **Built-in Functions**: Comes with some handy functions to save your day.
- **Arithmetic Expressions**: Do all the math you want, Kapybara style.
- **Boolean and Integer Types**: The bread and butter of programming, Kapybara style.
